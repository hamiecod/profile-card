## Overview
This is the solution to a frontend mentor challenge in which the participants had to make a responsive profile card design.<br>
I took this challenge too seriously :sweat_smile: as the participants were only instructed to make the design responsive for mobile devices and desktop devices, whereas I made it responsive for all kinds of devices - horizontal mobile devices and, vertical and horizontal tablet devices.

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided
- Make the design responsive
- Make a github repo for the project
- Host the project

## My process
- Made the directory structure and setup my local environment

- Made the design for desktops
- Made the design for miscellaneous devices :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Git
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I learnt how to make a design responsive for **all** type of devices, as earlier I only made the designs responsive for a common kind of mobile devices
- I learnt semantic versioning
- I learnt the tagging and releases system of git/github

### Continued development
- I would like to learn how to deploy to netlify and heroku

### Useful resources

- [Image color picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) - This helped me in picking colors accurately from the `.jpg` designs provided as i am not a pro member :grimacing:.
